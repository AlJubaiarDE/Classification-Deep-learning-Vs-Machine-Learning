## Overview
This project is a simple classification problem. I tried to solve and predict through Deep learning model & Machine learning model. After creating the model I tried to observe the differnce of the result. The data can be found on Kaggle, to be exact : https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted(charge-off), can we build a model that can predict whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan?
