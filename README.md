# Deep-learning Vs Machine-Learning

## Overview
This project is a simple classification problem. I tried to solve and predict through Deep learning model & Machine learning model. After creating the model I tried to observe the differnce of the result. The data can be found on Kaggle, to be exact : https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club

Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted(charge-off), can we build a model that can predict whether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan?

## Motivation

As I am begainner of Deep learning and recently I was watching a lot of keras and tensorflow videos. I was practising these but not in a whole project. So I thought, I would be fun to predict a classification data firstly with deep learning and then machine learning. I wanted to see which model gives me better result.

## Installation
The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after [cloning](https://www.howtogeek.com/451360/how-to-clone-a-github-repository/) the repository:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Tools
#### Environment
